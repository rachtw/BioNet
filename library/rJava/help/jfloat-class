     These classes wrap a numeric vector to be treated as 'float' or
     'long' argument when passed to Java and an integer vector to be
     treated as 'byte' or 'char'. R doesn't distinguish between
     'double' and 'float', but Java does. In order to satisfy object
     types, numeric vectors that should be converted to floats or long
     on the Java side must be wrapped in this class. In addition
     'jbyte' must be used when passing scalar byte (but not byte
     arrays, those are mapped into RAW vectors). Finally 'jchar' it
     used when mapping integer vectors into unicode Java character
     vectors.

     '.jchar' respectively.

     "jfloat" and "jlong": Class '"numeric"', from data part. Class
     '"vector"', by class '"numeric"'.

     "jbyte" and "jchar": Class '"integer"', from data part. Class
     '"vector"', by class '"integer"'.

_M_e_t_h_o_d_s:

     "jfloat" and "jlong" have no methods other than those inherited
     from "numeric". "jbyte" and "jchar" have no methods other than
     those inherited from "integer".
