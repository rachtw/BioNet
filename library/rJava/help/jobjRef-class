_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This class describes a reference to an object held in a JavaVM.

_O_b_j_e_c_t_s _f_r_o_m _t_h_e _C_l_a_s_s:

     Objects of this class should *not* be created directly. Instead,
     the function '.jnew' should be use to create new Java objects.
     They can also be created as results of the '.jcall' function.

_S_l_o_t_s:

     '_j_o_b_j': Internal identifier of the object (external pointer to be
          precise)

     '_j_c_l_a_s_s': Java class name of the object (in JNI notation)

     Java-side attributes are not accessed via slots, but the '$'
     operator instead.

_M_e_t_h_o_d_s:

     This object's Java methods are not accessed directly. Instead,
     '.jcall' JNI-API should be used for invoking Java methods. For
     convenience the '$' operator can be used to call methods via
     reflection API.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
