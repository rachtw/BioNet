_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     '.jsimplify' attempts to convert Java objects that represent
     simple scalars into corresponding scalar representation in R.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     .jsimplify(o)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       o: arbitrary object

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If 'o' is not a Java object reference, 'o' is returned as-is. If
     'o' is a reference to a scalar object (such as single integer,
     number, string or boolean) then the value of that object is
     returned as R vector of the corresponding type and length one.

     This function is used by '.jfield' to simplify the results of
     field access if required.

     Currently there is no function inverse to this, the usual way to
     wrap scalar values in Java references is to use '.jnew' as the
     corresponding constructor.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Simple scalar or 'o' unchanged.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
